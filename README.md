## Installation

Install the SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
composer require warrant-dev/warrant-php
```

Include the SDK using Composer's autoload:

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Usage

Import the Warrant client and pass your API key to the constructor to get started:

```js
$warrant = new \Warrant\Client(
    new \Warrant\Config("api_test_f5dsKVeYnVSLHGje44zAygqgqXiLJBICbFzCiAg1E=")
);

$newUser = $warrant->createUser(new \Warrant\User("my-user-id"));
```

Weâ€™ve used a random API key in these code examples. Replace it with your
[actual publishable API keys](https://app.warrant.dev) to
test this code through your own Warrant account.

For more information on how to use the Warrant API, please refer to the
[Warrant API reference](https://docs.warrant.dev).
